# Java LAME

Native Java port of the LAME library

## Prerequisites

This project is forked from https://github.com/nwaldispuehl/java-lame. Please read the original. 

The code is - as the original - licensed under the LGPL (see LICENSE).

## Objectives and warnings

This project is partially rebuilt (and will be rebuilt) only as a codec library for other libraries or projects. Thus, the use of this project as an independent application for file conversions has been abolished.

The main changes compared to the original are that the codec does not work with a specific file, but with the input stream, which allows using this library for streaming decoding of audio files.

The second most important changes will affect memory optimizations.

Also, the code will be given in accordance with the java code style.
